# Sim loop

`sim.Loop` is the one goroutine that owns `State` and the write path to the store.
Everything external — pause, resume, speed changes, status reads — enters through a
command channel and is applied at a tick boundary, with every applied command recorded
as an event. That makes the [[event-log]] the complete input record of a run.

## How it works

`Loop.Run(ctx)` is a state machine over three modes:

- **Paused**: no timer; block on commands or ctx. Resume restarts pacing fresh.
- **Timed** (interval > 0): a timer fires per `Speed.Interval()`; each firing runs one
  tick and advances the schedule by exactly one interval. If the loop falls more than
  one interval behind, the schedule resets to now — **no catch-up bursts**; the world
  slows honestly instead of skipping (FR-012).
- **Max speed** (interval 0): spin ticks back-to-back with a non-blocking command
  check and a `runtime.Gosched()` every 1024 ticks.

`runTick`: compute `stepEvents(state, nextTick)` (pure), advance `state.Tick`, apply
each event through the reducer, `AppendEvents` in one transaction, then `notify`
(the [[ipc-server]] broadcast — must never block). Every `SnapshotEveryTicks = 3600`
ticks it snapshots and prunes.

`handleCommand` implements idempotent semantics: pausing a paused world emits nothing;
`set_speed` to the current speed emits nothing; otherwise the `clock.*` event is
applied, appended, and broadcast, and a pause also triggers an immediate snapshot.
Replies carry a coherent `Status` snapshot (tick, game time, flags, last seq).

Auto-slow (`observeWindow`): every `degradeWindow = 5s` the loop compares achieved
ticks/sec against the requested rate; sustained shortfall below 90% emits
`clock.degraded` (with the measured rate), recovery to ≥95% emits `clock.recovered`.
At max speed whatever is achieved is the contract — no degradation events.

`Loop.Do(name, speed)` is the thread-safe entry used by IPC sessions; it fails cleanly
via the loop's `done` channel if the loop has stopped.

## Connections

[[game-clock]] supplies intervals; [[placeholder-sim]] supplies tick events;
[[sim-state-reducer]] is the mutation path; [[event-log]] and [[snapshots]] persist;
[[ipc-server]] feeds commands in and broadcasts events out; [[daemon-lifecycle]] owns
the ctx whose cancellation triggers the final snapshot.

## Operational notes

Measured throughput at max speed on the target machine: ~1.65M ticks/sec with the
placeholder sim. Store errors inside the loop are fatal (the daemon exits) — an
unwritable log must never silently diverge from state.
